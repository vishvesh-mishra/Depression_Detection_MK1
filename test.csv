The silence can be deafening, and I often find myself wishing for a sign, something to show me that I'm not alone in this. I keep hoping that tomorrow will be better, but each new day feels like a rerun of the last. I just want to feel something again."

The shared jokes, the familiar routines, the dreams you had for the future‚Äîall of it suddenly feels out of reach. I often wonder if I'll ever find that kind of connection again or if I'm destined to keep repeating the same mistakes. I know that healing takes time, but some days, it feels like the pain will never go away. All I can do is keep moving forward and hope that, someday, things will start to feel better."

Every day brings a new set of challenges, and sometimes it feels like I'm stuck in a cycle that never seems to break. The weight of expectations, both my own and those of others, can be so crushing. It's hard to breathe when every step feels like it takes me further from where I want to be."

Everyday it's like a nightmare
progressing on.

Everyday is another prayer
echohing from my bones
asking God
to take me now.

Everyday I close up more.

Everyday it gets more impossible.

Everyday I feel myself die some more.

Everyday | lay on my bed
wondering how
I'll leave this hell.

I've never felt so much pain.
